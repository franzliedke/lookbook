title: What is Lookbook?
---

Lookbook is a tool to help develop, test and document [ViewComponents](https://viewcomponent.org) in Rails applications.


It is built on top of ViewComponent's native [preview classes](https://viewcomponent.org/guide/previews.html) so works out-of-the-box for new and existing projects alike.
